# Common Diseases
Common Diseases are caught most often from traps, poisons,
or from fighting Diseased animals or people. Common Diseases
often start out relatively minor, but some progress severely.
Common Diseases are often spread through contact or bodily
fluids, preventing them from breaking out into full blown
plagues.

Common Diseases bear mild social stigma, which can escalate
to disgust and suspicion if it is allowed to develop into later
stages. Given the ease of treating Common Diseases, only the
truly destitute and unfaithful are afflicted with what is seen as
their just due.

## Effects of Common Diseases
All Common Diseases cause the following effects in their victims:
### Stage One Symptoms
Diseased (+10)

### Stage Two Symptoms

### Stage Three Symptoms

All Common Diseases can be cured by using any spell level Cure
Disease spell or potion. Any Common Disease can also be cured
by sincere repentance and piousness at a shrine to one of the
Eight and One. Infected animals typically ignore the effects of
the Common Diseases they carry.
