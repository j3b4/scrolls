# Documentation
Presumably players will want to access help ingame with a command. They might also want to browse and read lore as well as 
nitty gritty command help through a browser.  I assume it will be possible for both interfaces to pull from the same docss.

# Help Sections
  1. [x] races
  2. [x] birthsigns
